🎯 SISTEM STAKEHOLDER-AWARE AUTHENTICATION FLOW
📊 CURRENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS
❌ The Problem You've Identified

HOMEPAGE STAKEHOLDER SELECTION:
👤 Individual User → /register
🏢 Organization → /register  
⚖️ Regulator → /compliance

AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM:
"Launch App" → /login (generic, no context)
Disconnect Issue:

Stakeholder context hilang between homepage dan registration
User harus menjelaskan ulang stakeholder type mereka
Registration form tidak tailored berdasarkan pilihan awal
🎯 CONCEPTUAL SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
SOLUTION: INTELLIGENT CONTEXT PASSING
Step 1: Smart Stakeholder Routing

USER ACTION → SYSTEM ROUTING → CONTEXT PRESERVATION
Instead of generic /register, create intelligent routing:


Individual User Selection → /register-individual
Organization Selection → /register-organization
Regulator Interest → /explore-compliance (public access)
Undecided User → /guided-registration
Step 2: Context-Aware Registration Forms

REGISTRATION FORM ADAPTS based on stakeholder type:
Individual User Form:

Minimal fields: email, password, name
Focus: personal consent management
Outcome: user dashboard dengan consent tools
Organization Form:

Business validation fields: company name, industry, contact
Compliance questions: GDPR role, data types processed
Outcome: controller dashboard dengan management tools
Regulator Flow:

Public exploration first → optional registration for full access
Educational content → compliance statistics → audit tools
Outcome: regulator dashboard dengan enforcement capabilities
🔄 ENHANCED USER JOURNEY DESIGN
SCENARIO 1: Decisive Individual User

User Journey:
Homepage → "I want to manage my data" → Individual Registration → Auto-Directed to User Dashboard

Form Experience:
- Greeting: "Welcome! We'll help you set up privacy controls"
- Fields: Email, Password, Full Name (minimum required)
- Auto-redirect: "Personal Consent Dashboard"
SCENARIO 2: Organization Representative

User Journey:
Homepage → "We need GDPR compliance tools" → Organization Registration → Validation Required → Controller Dashboard

Form Experience:
- Greeting: "Welcome! Let's set up your data controller tools"
- Fields: Company details, compliance role, contact info
- Additional step: Document verification for legitimacy
- Auto-redirect: "Consent Management Console"
SCENARIO 3: Regulator Interest

User Journey:
Homepage → "We monitor compliance" → Explore Public Dashboard → Optional Registration → Full Access

Form Experience:
- Step 1: Public compliance transparency (no login required)
- Step 2: "Want full audit access?" → Regulator registration
- Fields: Official credentials, jurisdiction, authority level
- Auto-redirect: "Audit & Enforcement Dashboard"
SCENARIO 4: Undecided User

User Journey:
Homepage → "Not sure?" → Guided Quiz → Contextual Registration → Personalized Dashboard

Quiz Experience:
- 3 simple questions: "What's your main goal?"
- Auto-determine: Individual/Organization/Regulator
- Guided to appropriate registration flow
🎨 UX FLOW IMPROVEMENTS

Rationale:

Forms can be optimized per use case
Clear expectations from the start
Easier to measure conversion per stakeholder
Better user experience (relevant fields only)
2. DECISION: Auto-Login vs Manual Login
Choice: AUTO-LOGIN after registration

Rationale:

Reduces friction in user journey
Immediate value delivery
Higher completion rates
Modern user expectations
3. DECISION: Progressive vs Immediate Access
Choice: PROGRESSIVE ACCESS LEVELS

Rationale:

Builds trust gradually
Validates users appropriately
Prevents abuse
Allows for different verification levels
4. DECISION: Public vs Private First Experience
Choice: PUBLIC-FIRST untuk regulators, PRIVATE-FIRST untuk others

Rationale:

Transparency builds trust with regulators
Private focus appropriate for individuals/organizations
Reduces barrier to entry for compliance monitoring
